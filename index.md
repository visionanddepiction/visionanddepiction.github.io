# Intro
After two conferences The Skin of Things [2018](https://theskinofthings.github.io) and [2021](https://theskinofthings2021.github.io) that focussed on the depiction and perception of *material properties*, we decided to broaden the scope and organise **Vision and Depiction 2024**. It will take place in the lovely Dutch city of *Delft* from *7-9 February 2024*.

# About Vision and Depiction
This conference about pictorial production and perception aims to bring artists, designers, and scientists together to discuss various overlapping themes. These themes are based on the Vision and Depiction framework, which describes the form and content of pictures. The main talk sessions will center around the four pictorial factors: texture, light/color, space, and material. Within these themes, we hope to evoke discussions on both the medium and representation but also in the directions of semiotics and iconography and further contextual contemplation.
