# Intro
After two conferences The Skin of Things [2018](https://theskinofthings.github.io) and [2021](https://theskinofthings2021.github.io) that focussed on the depiction and perception of *material properties*, we decided to broaden the scope and organise **Vision and Depiction 2024**. It will take place in the lovely Dutch city of *Delft* from *7-9 February 2024*.

# About
This conference about pictorial production and perception aims to bring artists, designers, and scientists together to discuss various overlapping themes. These themes are based on our Vision and Depiction framework that has been developed while teaching about perception and communication. The framework describes the form and content of pictures. For now, we envision four main talk sessions centring around the four pictorial factors: texture, light/color, space, and material. Within these themes, we hope to evoke discussions on both the medium and representation but also in the directions of semiotics and iconography and further contextual contemplation.
