Vision and Depiction celebrates form as interface between art and science. It is a conference about how to depict form, and how form is perceived. But it is also a conference about the many connections that form has with the content and context of pictures. Thirdly, it is a conference about the interaction between the physical medium of pictures, and the mental presentations it gives rise to, about the medium and motif.
